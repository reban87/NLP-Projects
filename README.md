## **NLP Using Transformers**


**ðŸ“‘ Named Entity Recognition (NER)** is one of the major tasks that are required to be performed in many NLP tasks. Achieving state-of-the-art performance in NER is very difficult. Transformers can be considered as the pre-trained models that can be used in every aspect of data science to achieve high performance
